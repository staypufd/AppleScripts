# AppleScripts
Some AppleScripts I've created.

Display Menu Scripts
  These scripts are for changing the pivot (rotation) of the display setting. I have a ASUS MG28U 4K monitor that pivots and so wanted a automated way to change the setting when I plugged it in. You can customize this to work with your monitor(s).
  1. Set4KLandscape.scpt
  2. Set4KPortrait.scpt
